                    <p>Now, this is a story all about how
                    My life got flipped-turned upside down
                    And I'd like to take a minute
                    Just sit right there
                    I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air

                    In west Philadelphia born and raised
                    On the playground was where I spent most of my days
                    Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
                    And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school
                    When a couple of guys who were up to no good
                    Started making trouble in my neighborhood
                    I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
                    She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'</p>
